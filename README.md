# **Victoria Condos's Personal Website**

Last Updated: September 2021

This github page serves as my personal website where I plan to post about myself as well as to link some of the projects that I have worked on at the University of South Carolina. Due to the confidential nature of my work, I am not able to post any projects that I have worked on at Lockheed Martin (other than the intern projects that have been approved to post), so I plan on creating blog posts to talk about some of the skills that I use during my internship without going into too much depth.
