            <hr class="w3-opacity">
            <p>
                My name is Victoria Condos. <br />

                I am a woman in computing at Lockheed Martin Rotary and Missions Systems. <br />

                My current role is as a software intern where I serve remotely. In this position last summer, I worked on test automation. Also, I acted as project manager for my intern team as part of the Summer 2020 RMS Intern Project. As a result of this work, I have been invited to return to the internship program during the summer of 2021. <br />

                As a result of my success in my intern role, I have been asked to serve as an Intern Ambassador for the 2020-2021 academic year: an opportunity only offered to 20 of over 800 RMS Interns! <br />

                I am also the director of logistics for my sorority, Gamma Phi Beta, Zeta Sigma Chapter. In this position, I lead a team of women in organizing meetings between potential and active members during recruitment and tracking the votes from each round. <br />

                In fact, my hard work paid off when we successfully recruited the largest pledge class on campus in 2019 with 142 new members joining our sorority. <br />

                On a personal note, I enjoy spending my free time snowboarding, hiking, or reading!
            </p>

            <h4>June 1, 2020: My First Day as a Lockheed Martin Software Intern</h4>
            <p>My first day as a Lockheed Martin intern may have been different than I imagined my first day of my first internship would be, but I wouldn't change a thing. Due to Covid-19, my internship that was originally supposed to be in person was moved to be completely remote. My first day of work started with a meeting with my manager and all of the other interns to get a chance for all of us to introduce ourselves. After that, our day was spent listening to orientation presentations where we learned about the Trident submarine, our role at the Mitchel Field site, and day to day intern tasks. Once all of the presentations were over, we were able to chat with our intern buddies (employees that are each assigned one intern to act as a guide for throughout the entire summer), and we also started working on completing some training exercises that taught us about workplace procedures. I really enjoyed how relaxed my first day of my internship was because it gave me a chance to get comfortable with day to day operations as well as to get to know the people that I would be working with before jumping into my actual tasks. </p>
