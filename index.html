            <hr class="w3-opacity">
            <p>
                My name is Victoria Condos. <br />

                I am a woman in computing at Lockheed Martin Rotary and Missions Systems. <br />

                My current role is as a software intern where I serve remotely. In this position last summer, I worked on test automation. Also, I acted as project manager for my intern team as part of the Summer 2020 RMS Intern Project. As a result of this work, I have been invited to return to the internship program during the summer of 2021. <br />

                As a result of my success in my intern role, I have been asked to serve as an Intern Ambassador for the 2020-2021 academic year: an opportunity only offered to 20 of over 800 RMS Interns! <br />

                I am also the director of logistics for my sorority, Gamma Phi Beta, Zeta Sigma Chapter. In this position, I lead a team of women in organizing meetings between potential and active members during recruitment and tracking the votes from each round. <br />

                In fact, my hard work paid off when we successfully recruited the largest pledge class on campus in 2019 with 142 new members joining our sorority. <br />

                On a personal note, I enjoy spending my free time snowboarding, hiking, or reading!
            </p>

            <h4>This Website!</h4>
            <p>I began creating this website as a summer project during May 2021. When I was a teaching assistant for CSCE 190 (Computing in the Modern World), my students created their own github.io pages little by little throughout the semester to display what they have been working on as well as to expose them to coding. When I took CSCE 190 as a freshman, there was no coding in the cirriculum, so I was helping students create github.io pages without having ever created one myself! Because of this, I decided that now would be the perfect time to develop my own website that will display information about me and projects that I have worked on. Also, due to the confidential nature of the work that I do at my internship at Lockheed Martin, I decided to create a blog that will allow me to explain what I do at work and what skills I am developing from the projects that I have worked on.</p> 
            <p>To create this website, I started out with a template that I downloaded from w3schools.com and then heavily altered it to make it my own and to reflect my personality. Since I have never taken a course in HTML or CSS, creating this website is a learning process, but with the help of W3Schools as well as some miscellaneous google searches, I am creating a place to show who I am both inside and outside of the coding world!</p>

               During my internship at Lockheed Martin, I had the opportunity to attend the RMS Women in Computing Summit via Zoom.

            <h4>June 1, 2020: My First Day as a Lockheed Martin Software Intern</h4>
            <p>My first day as a Lockheed Martin intern may have been different than I imagined my first day of my first internship would be, but I wouldn't change a thing. Due to Covid-19, my internship that was originally supposed to be in person was moved to be completely remote. My first day of work started with a meeting with my manager and all of the other interns to get a chance for all of us to introduce ourselves. After that, our day was spent listening to orientation presentations where we learned about the Trident Submarines, our role at the Mitchel Field site, and day to day intern tasks. Once all of the presentations were over, we were able to chat with our intern buddies (employees that are each assigned one intern to act as a guide for throughout the entire summer), and we also started working on completing some training exercises that taught us about workplace procedures. I really enjoyed how relaxed my first day of my internship was because it gave me a chance to get comfortable with day to day operations as well as to get to know the people that I would be working with before jumping into my actual tasks. </p>
